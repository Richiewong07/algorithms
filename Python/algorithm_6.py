# The Collatz Conjecture goes like this:
# 
# Take any number n. If n is even, divide it by 2, if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process indefinitely, and you'll eventually reach 1.
# 
# Given a num variable, can you print all the numbers in num's Collatz sequence until 1 is reached? Print the numbers space-separated (and each test case on its own line).
